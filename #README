hydrogen-boron-nitride-Graphene-hydrogen structures provided by Anatoly

At tis moment (Fri Oct 28) two stacking arrangements (AA and AB) which unit cells look like: 
                    AA (x=-0.5y,z plane)        AB (yz plane)
                                                
                    H                           H  
                    N                           N  
                      B                           B
                      C                           C
                    C                               C
